# Auto-encoders

This Jupyter notebook is mainly on auto-encoders. It briefly discusses some sidely related subjects. In this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKzGHpkpoKI) I give some background to it, if needed. This notebook was part of an [assignment for the OU.nl course Gen-AI] . (https://github.com/wilfred11/auto-encoders/blob/main/gen-ai-opdr1-wvc.pdf).
